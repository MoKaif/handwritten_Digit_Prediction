# Handwritten Digit Classification using Neural Networks

This project demonstrates the process of building and training a neural network for classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The goal is to provide a step-by-step guide to preprocessing data, designing a neural network, training the model, and evaluating its performance.

## Project Objective

The primary objective of this project is to create a machine learning model that accurately classifies handwritten digits. The project is divided into the following key steps:

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing:** Loading the MNIST dataset, flattening pixel matrices, and applying feature scaling for optimal training.

2. **Neural Network Model Construction:** Designing a neural network architecture using Keras' `Sequential` API, configuring layers, and compiling the model.

3. **Model Training and Evaluation:** Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets, training the neural network, and evaluating model accuracy.

4. **Performance Analysis:** Generating a confusion matrix to visualize prediction results and creating a classification report for a comprehensive performance analysis.

## Getting Started

To run this notebook and reproduce the results, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MoKaif/handwritten_Digit_Prediction.git
   ```
2. Open and run the notebook using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
3. Or copy the colab file.

## Results

Upon running the notebook, you will achieve the following results:

1. **Model Accuracy:** The accuracy of the trained neural network model on the test data is calculated and displayed. This provides an overall measure of the model's correctness in classifying handwritten digits.

2. **Confusion Matrix Visualization:** A confusion matrix is generated to visualize the model's predictions in comparison to the actual labels. The heatmap representation enhances the understanding of how well the model performs for each digit class.

3. **Classification Report:** A detailed classification report is produced, presenting precision, recall, F1-score, and support metrics for each individual digit class. This report offers a comprehensive analysis of the model's performance at a granular level.

These results collectively provide valuable insights into the model's performance, its strengths, and areas that might require further optimization.

Feel free to explore and interpret the results to gain a deeper understanding of how well the neural network model is performing on the handwritten digit classification task.

## Future Enhancements

This project provides a solid foundation for digit classification using neural networks. Here are some potential future enhancements to consider:

- Experiment with different neural network architectures to improve accuracy.
- Explore data augmentation techniques to increase dataset diversity.
- Fine-tune hyperparameters to achieve better model performance.
- Implement advanced models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for improved image recognition.
